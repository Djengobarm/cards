### How It Works
It shows you some word in English. Read it and also say out loud its translation into russian.
Then press "Open" button. (If you don't remember the translation-just press "Open").

After "Open" button has been pressed - right tranlsation is shown.
If you remembered the translation correctly - click "Yes" button. The probability you'll see this card again will decrease.

If right translation differs from your version (or you were not able to remember it at all) - click "No" button. And the card will be shown to you again soon.
